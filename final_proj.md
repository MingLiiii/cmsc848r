# Final Project

* In groups of 2-4 students. Exceptions for groups of single students will be made if you are already doing research with a professor in the department on a relevant topic and/or are a PhD student already doing relevant work (form coming soon).
* We will provide details on compute resources and project expectations soon.
* The project will be broken down into 3 steps throughout the semester (more details coming soon).
* All students in a group will get the same grade, barring exceptional circumstances.
* The project should propose and make first steps towards implementing a new project that would extend a clearly identified past research contribution. Your goal is not to summarize the background work. We want you to build creatively on what you’ve read and learned this semester.
* n-page report (in the style of ACL conference paper) due at the final exam date (12/19), where n=2+num_people_in_group. References don’t count toward the page limit. Please use the ACL 2025 style files without modification.
* More details to come by the second week of class.
