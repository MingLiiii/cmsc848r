# Course Policies

## Communication
Discussion is a crucial component in a seminar, and I welcome questions during and after class. I particularly encourage you to raise questions in class since other students may have similar questions and would benefit from the answer. The second-best option is to publicly post your question on Piazza or come to office hours. If you would like to send a private message to the instructors, please email us at the shared course email. Please **DO NOT** email me about course-related topics. Exceptions include matters you prefer to keep private, such as reasons for absence or ADS accommodations. In that case, if you email me directly, please include the header `[CMSC848R]` in the subject line.

I will send **IMPORTANT** announcements via ELMS messaging and/or Piazza. You must ensure that your email & announcement notifications (including changes in assignments and/or due dates) are enabled in ELMS and Piazza so you do not miss any messages. You are responsible for checking your email, Piazza, and Canvas/ELMS inbox with regular frequency.

## Excused Absences
Any student who needs to be excused for an absence from **two or more consecutive class meetings** due to a medically necessitated absence shall make a reasonable attempt to inform the instructor of their illness **prior** to the class. Upon returning, present the instructor with a self-signed note attesting to the date of the illness. Each note must contain an acknowledgment by the student that the information provided is true and correct. Providing false information to University officials is prohibited under Part 9(i) of the Code of Student Conduct (V-1.00(B) University of Maryland Code of Student Conduct) and may result in disciplinary action.

For further details, see the *Policy on Excused Absence*. Key points include:

1. **Timely notification** – Provide notice prior to the absence or as soon afterwards as possible.
2. **Religious observances, athletic events, planned absences** – Inform the instructor during the schedule adjustment period.
3. **Documentation** – Must be provided in writing as specified in the syllabus.
4. **Self-signed notes** – Students may, **one time per course per semester**, provide a self-signed excuse for a single class that does not coincide with a major assessment or assignment due date.
5. **Verification** – For other medically necessitated absences, the instructor may request documentation from a physician or the University Health Center (dates of treatment only, no diagnostic information).

## Academic Integrity
The University’s *Code of Academic Integrity* is designed to ensure that the principles of academic honesty and integrity are upheld. The University of Maryland does **not** tolerate academic dishonesty. All acts of academic dishonesty will be handled in accordance with the Code. It is **your** responsibility to understand and adhere to this Code. If you are ever unclear about acceptable levels of collaboration, **ask first!**

### Use of Generative AI
Generative AI **should not** be used in any portion of the writing assignments for idea generation. Generative AI *may* be used for grammar, spellcheck, or rewrites **only after you have written an initial version yourself**. You take full responsibility for the submitted text (e.g., factual accuracy). **Disclose** any AI usage (model and purpose) in a one-sentence statement at the bottom of the document.

## Accommodations (Accessibility & Disability Services)
The University of Maryland is committed to creating and maintaining a welcoming and inclusive environment for people of all abilities. The Accessibility & Disability Service (ADS) provides reasonable accommodations to qualified individuals. ADS cannot assist retroactively, so request accommodations **several weeks before the semester begins** or as soon as a disability becomes known.

For assistance, contact ADS at **301-314-7682** or *adsfrontdesk@umd.edu*. Send your accommodation letter to the instructors within the **first two weeks** of the semester.

## Communication with Peers / Anti-Harassment
With a diversity of perspectives, disagreements may arise. We agree to conduct ourselves professionally and foster a respectful classroom environment. Free speech is encouraged, but this course is **not** a space for hate speech, harassment, or derogatory language.

Any behavior that threatens this atmosphere (including harassment, sexual harassment, and racially or culturally derogatory language) will **not** be tolerated. Alert the instructor immediately if you feel threatened, dismissed, or silenced, or if your engagement has been hindered by the learning environment.

## Policies and Resources for Graduate Courses
It is our shared responsibility to know and abide by University policies related to all courses, including:
