# Student Presentations

* Each student must present twice during the semester, in a group of 2 or 3 students.
* Signup is first-come first-served on the Google Sheet linked above.
* There will primarily be 3 papers per presentation.
* The presentation should be 45 minutes in length. A recommended breakdown is: shared or common background (7-8 mins), 10 mins per paper, conclusion and discussion topics (7-8 mins).
* Presenters will then lead a 25-30 minute discussion after the presentation.
* All presenters will work on a shared Google Slides presentation, and share it with instructors (via shared email from one presenter, with others CCed) 2 days in advance of presentation date for feedback. If you don’t hear anything back from us, that’s a good sign!
* Presenters should work together to present papers in a cohesive and unified way rather than simply presenting 3 disjoint talks.
* Weekly due dates: by Sunday 11:59pm (slides for Tuesday’s papers) and by Tuesday 11:59pm (slides for Thursday’s papers)
* You are encouraged to get started in advance so you can come to office hours if needed.
* All students in a group will get the same grade, barring exceptional circumstances.
* See the following guidelines for presentations: https://rulinshao.github.io/cse599/presentation.html (we’ll post our specific guidelines to the course website soon).
